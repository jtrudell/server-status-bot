# server-status-bot
A Discord Bot that fetches the IP of a Minecraft server and sends info about the server to a Discord server.


With help of YouTube tutorials, a teeny bit of Javascript knowledge, and node.js, I have started working on this project.

This project requires **[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**, **[discord.js](https://discord.js.org/?source=post_page---------------------------#/)**, and a IDE. I'm using **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)**.


To open the files, just right-click on the main folder and click "*Open with Code*". That should open the files in Code, and auto-open the **main.js** file.
